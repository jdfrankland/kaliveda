run=2016 | HV 10kV on target
run=3000 | INDRA and FAZIA (independent)
run=4000 | Petit bouclier devant FAZIA. Increased intensity.
run=5000 | Grand bouclier devant FAZIA. Much higher intensity.
run=5002 | Run stopped by plantage Narval.

run=7000 | INDRA and FAZIA (independent). HV 8kV on target.
run=8000 | Petit bouclier devant FAZIA.
run=9000 | Grand bouclier devant FAZIA. Increased intensity.
run=11000 | Slight decentring of beam, to the left in INDRA, to the right in FAZIA (with grand bouclier).
run=12000 | All FAZIA triggers disabled, still with grand bouclier in place.
run=13000 | INDRA and FAZIA (independent), INDRA rings 13-17 not in trigger, only Si1 in FAZIA
run=14000 | INDRA rings 13-17 back in trigger, only Si1 in FAZIA

run=35000 | Merging INDRA-FAZIA with 2.5us window. Note:in all previous runs, some INDRA timestamps/scalers are corrupted (bad parsing)
run=40000 | Run with independent INDRA/FAZIA just to test sequence of timestamps
run=43000 | Merging with INDRA@3400Hz, FAZIA@800Hz
