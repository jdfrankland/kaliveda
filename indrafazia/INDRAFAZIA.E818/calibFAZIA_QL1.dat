# ADC channel to MeV using 239Pu 241Am 244Cm 3-alpha source and elastic peaks of the reaction:
# 12C(q=4+) + 197Au(980µg/cm²) @8.75 MeV/nucleon
# Peaks extraction was done using gaussian fit on the Si1 QL1 ADC channel polts
# The scattered nucleus energy has been computed with the KVElasticScatter class
