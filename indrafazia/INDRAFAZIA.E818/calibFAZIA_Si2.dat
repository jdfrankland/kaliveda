# ADC channel to MeV using elastic peaks of the reaction:
# 12C(q=4+) + 197Au(980µg/cm²) @13.75 MeV/nucleon
# Peaks extraction was done using 2D gaussian fit on the Si1-Si2 ADC channel correlation polts
# The scattered nucleus energy has been computed with the KVElasticScatter class
# Energy loss in Si2 computed using Si1 calibrated energy
